One day I decided to check my server logs, and I saw that English-speaking players were using offensive language such as the word gay. 
I am against this propaganda, it made me angry and I implemented a system that bans them for this word, no matter how much text they write, if this word is used in the text, then a chat ban cannot be avoided. 
If you are also against this propaganda, install this script on your server

## Setup
Move the file to resource >> freerom
##

Edit the meta.xml file by adding the script there
```Xml
<script src="antigay.js" type="server" language="javascript" />
```
